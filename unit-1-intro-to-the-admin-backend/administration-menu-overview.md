# Administration menu overview

{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/469224679/6f737ea566" %}

The Admin bar gives you access to a variety of functions. When you hover your mouse over the various menus in the Admin bar \(without actually clicking on ANY of these menus\), most of them expand 2 reveal more options. Let’s try one that has multiple levels: Using the Admin menu again, navigate to _Manage → Structure → Content types → Standard page → Manage fields_.

**Tip:** Depending on your account’s level of permissions, you may see some menu items missing from the Admin menu. This is by design; it’s not a flaw. This is in line with the user roles and permissions discussed at the beginning of this manual.

Try using the back/forward buttons in your browser to navigate back and forth between the two previous admin pages we’ve visited \(Content and Manage fields\). Alternatively, open these pages in two separate browser tabs. If you don’t know how to do this, ask your trainer to help you.

While logged in and switching between the various pages in the admin interface, you’ll find that the administration area stays quite consistent across the entire site.

The Admin menu is by default placed horizontally across the top of the page in the standard desktop view. However, when on mobile view it automatically switches to a vertical display across the left-hand side of the screen. Although the switch to this mobile mode happens automatically on smaller screen sizes, you can also manually trigger it. Simply click the **vertical orientation** button, on the far right of the Admin menu:

This is what the Admin menu looks like when placed vertically.

In “mobile” mode, the menus in the Admin bar don’t expand automatically when you hover your mouse over them \(because on mobile devices there is no mouse\). To expand a menu item, click on the circle with the downwards-pointing arrow that is found to the right of the menu item you want to expand \(1\). When expanded, the arrow icon changes to an x \(2\). Click that x to collapse any expanded menu.

To switch the Admin menu back to its default position, click the **horizontal orientation** button, located at the bottom right of the Admin bar \(3\).

The “Manage” menu in the Admin bar contains the following items, with the ones of most use to Content Administrators highlighted in **bold**:

* **Content** - This is where you manage the site’s content pages and files \(video, audio documents, etc.\). **This training course focuses on this area.**
* Structure - This admin feature allows structural configuration of the site such as content types, types of blocks, how breadcrumbs are displayed, etc.
* Appearance - This is where developers can manage the site’s theme, which controls how the site looks visually.
* Extend - Enable and disable extra modules that come with the GovCMS distribution to provide extra functionality for your site.
* Configuration - This area is usually only available to site admins. Custom modules and core configuration is controlled here.
* People - Manage users, roles and permissions for GovCMS users.
* **Reports** - You can access a range of site reports, such as available fields, user actions, Google Analytics, etc.
* Help - Access some basic GovCMS help files.Exercise 1.3: Adding a non-admin user

  In this exercise you’ll create a new user account. This is the user account that you’ll use for the rest of this course \(instead of the admin account\).

  1. From the Admin menu, navigate to _People → Add a new user_
  2. Select “Content Author” and "Content Approver" from the Roles area at the top
  3. Use training@example.com as the address \(we don’t need a working email address for the purpose of this training session\)
  4. Enter your name as the username
  5. Fill in a password \(notice what happens if it isn’t complex enough\). **Make a note of your password!**
  6. Make sure the status is set to “Active”
  7. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Create new account** button
  8. Click on the **admin** username at the top right of the Admin menu, then from the menu that appears to the left, click **Log out**
  9. Log back in as the newly created user

  What do you notice is different about the site? Discuss with your trainer.

  **Tip**: The user you first logged in as \(the admin user\) is the "super user" of the site. Best practice dictates that no one should use the admin user for day-to-day tasks. Users on the GovCMS SaaS platform do not have access to this user account at all, while on the GovCMS PaaS platform this user account is reserved for those managing your site \(such as people in your IT department and/or your developer team\).

  **Note:** During this course, you’ll probably need to log back in as admin to complete some of the exercises. Your trainer will let you know when this needs to happen.
