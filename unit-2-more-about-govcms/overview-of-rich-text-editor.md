# Overview of Rich text editor

The Rich Text Editor provides a number of buttons/tools that are similar to those used in word-processing software like Microsoft Word. The screenshot below shows the top menu of the Rich Text Editor.

While many of the buttons are self-explanatory \(e.g. bold, italics, etc.\) we would like to call out three specific functions:

1. Links
2. Pasting from MS Word
3. Inserting media files

**Links**

The link button is used to link to a page outside your website or to an internal page. For external links, simply copy and paste the URL into the URL field \(e.g. [www.govcms.gov.au](http://www.govcms.gov.au/)\). For internal links \(i.e. to link to another page within your website\) start typing the title of the page into the URL field. As you type, a list of suggested pages will drop down. Click on the page you’d like from the list, then click **Insert Link**.![](../.gitbook/assets/29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%281%29.png)

**Pasting from MS Word**

When copying text from Microsoft Word, the Rich Text widget will try to replicate the formatting of the original text. This can lead to inconsistent fonts, text size, etc. You can avoid this problem by clicking the **Paste from Word** button. On older browsers \(such as MS IE &lt; 11\) this will open a small pop-up window. When you paste text into this pop-up window the formatting will be removed, so the text will match your site’s text formatting requirements. Modern browsers paste the cleared text and preserve the heading formats, links and lists for you. ![](../.gitbook/assets/30%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29.png)

**Note**: If you’re typing the text directly into the Rich Text Editor, the text will automatically be formatted in the style setup by the designers and developers who created the site.

**Tip:** Many modern browsers are aware of the problem and support text cleaning function out-of-the-box. For this reason, browsers like Chrome or Firefox will not show the pop-up box and paste the text with all unnecessary styling removed - yet preserving headers.
