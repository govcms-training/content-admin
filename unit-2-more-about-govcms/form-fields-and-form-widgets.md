# Form fields and form widgets

As you begin creating content, you’ll discover various form fields and field widgets that are available. Let’s take the following example: **Create Standard Page** form - _Content → Add Content → Standard Page_.

Note that each form field is represented by a different widget. Some fields may change the widget in use - for example, the Thumbnail Media Library widget may be changed to an image upload. Body text is using the Rich Text editor widget, but may be replaced with a text area.

Widgets are configured to make the job of Content Editor easier, to facilitate adding content and provide the best content editing experience.

By following the exercises in this manual, you’ll experience the majority of field widgets available in GovCMS.

_Please note that field widgets are configured by a site builder - your development partner. Field widgets may be different between websites even though using the same GovCMS distribution._
