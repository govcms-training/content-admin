### Advanced - content bulk operations

There are many content operations that can be performed in bulk. In GovCMS the standard content operations that can be performed in bulk are:

* Delete content
* Make content sticky
* Promote content to front page
* Publish content
* Save content
* Remove content from front page
* Unpublish content
* Update URL alias

These bulk operations allow you to quickly and easily make the above changes to multiple pages.
